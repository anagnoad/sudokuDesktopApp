	<h2> Classic Sudoku </h2>
	<p>   (One player game) </p>
	<p>
		Classic Sudoku is the most common of the types of sudoku played.
		The board comprises of a 9x9 board, divided into 9 boxes of 3x3.
		The player's goal is to complete the sudoku game, by entering number, from 1 to 9 to each cell, without repeating the same number in the same row, the same column or the same 3x3 sub-box.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are some sudokus that require a lot of effort and time to complete, as they require specific number to be put in specific places inside the sudoku board.

	<h2> HyperSudoku </h2>
	<p>   (One player game) </p>
	<p>
		Hypersudoku is a variant of the classic Sudoku. The classic rules apply to this puzzle as well, but there is on more restriction. There are 3x3 boxes that are "displaced" in relation to the classic 3x3 boxes. As a result, it tends to be more difficult to solve and require checking another parameter.

	<h2> Duidoku </h2>
	<p>   (Two-players game) </p>
	<p>
		Duidoku is another variant of the Sudoku puzzle. This time, the player is not alone, but plays against another player(s). The rules are the same with the classic sudoku, with one big difference; the winner is the last player to make a move on the sudoku board.
